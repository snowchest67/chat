# 🗨️ Local Chat in Go — Learning Project

Welcome to my experimental local chat app built in Go!  
This is a learning-focused project where I'm exploring Go's networking, concurrency, and CLI capabilities by building a simple chat system that runs locally.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Learn Go by building something fun and interactive
- Practice client-server architecture and goroutines
- Invite feedback and ideas from fellow developers

## 💡 What This Chat App Does

- Starts a local server that handles multiple chat clients
- Clients can connect via terminal and exchange messages
- All communication happens locally — no external servers

## 🧠 How You Can Help

I'm still learning Go, so any feedback is welcome! You can help by:

- Reviewing the code and suggesting improvements
- Pointing out better ways to handle errors, concurrency, or structure
- Sharing resources or patterns you love in Go
- Opening an [Issue](https://github.com/snowchest67/todo/issues/1#issue-3489238452) with tips, questions, or ideas
- Leaving a message in the feedback.txt file (see below)

## ✍️ Leave a Message

Want to say hi or share a thought?  
You can leave a message by:

1. Forking the repo
2. Adding your message to feedback.txt
3. Creating a pull request

I'll read every message — even if it's just a Go pun or a hello from your terminal!

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
go run server/main.go
# In another terminal
go run client/main.go
```
